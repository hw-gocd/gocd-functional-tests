  body: 'ID sets up a basic framework for implementing an id based sessioning service.
    Cookies sent to the client for maintaining sessions will only contain an id reference.
    Only #get_session and #set_session are required to be overwritten.'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: All parameters are optional.
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  type: :BULLET

    body: ":key determines the name of the cookie, by default it is 'rack.session'"
    label: '*'
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: ":path, :domain, :expire_after, :secure, and :httponly set the related cookie \
      options as by Rack::Response#add_cookie"
    label: '*'

    body: ":defer will not set a cookie in the response."
    label: '*'
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: ":renew (implementation dependent) will prompt the generation of a new session \
      id, and migration of data to be referenced at the new id. If :defer is set, \
      it will be overridden and the cookie will be set."
    label: '*'
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: ":sidbits sets the number of bits in length that a generated session id \
      will be."
    label: '*'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: These options can be set on a per request basis, at the location of env['rack.session.options'].
    Additionally the id of the session can be found within the options hash at the
    key :id. It is highly not recommended to change its value.
