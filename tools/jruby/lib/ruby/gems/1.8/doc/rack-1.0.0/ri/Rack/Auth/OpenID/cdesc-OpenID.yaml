comment: 
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Rack::Auth::OpenID provides a simple method for setting up an OpenID Consumer.
    It requires the ruby-openid library from janrain to operate, as well as a rack
    method of session management.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The ruby-openid home page is at http://openidenabled.com/ruby-openid/.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The OpenID specifications can be found at http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-1_1.html
    and http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html. Documentation for
    published OpenID extensions and related topics can be found at http://openid.net/developers/specs/.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: It is recommended to read through the OpenID spec, as well as ruby-openid's
    documentation, to understand what exactly goes on. However a setup as simple as
    the presented examples is enough to provide Consumer functionality.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This library strongly intends to utilize the OpenID 2.0 features of the ruby-openid
    library, which provides OpenID 1.0 compatiblity.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'NOTE: Due to the amount of data that this library stores in the session,
    Rack::Session::Cookie may fault.'
