AgentDetails
------------

tags: 2090, agents

* Trigger pipelines "normal-pipeline" and wait for labels "1" to pass
* Trigger pipelines "basic" and wait for label "1" to pass for stage "2"

* Trigger pipeline "failing-pipeline"
* Wait for labels "1" to fail
* Navigate to stage "failingStage" of run "1" having counter "1"

make sure the agent has completed the job
* Verify the lock status is "Click to unlock"
